TODO: 

 - Make pos of player be set to a number of tiles from left edge




 - Make sure hiscore works (on both Game over and Won)

 - Pause on game over before you can continue (to hear the slow music)

 - Show hiscore on title screen
 - Show player in middle on win screen

 - Test on mobiles.  Works fine on Android :) ... but what about Apple ?  It does run horrible in Safari ...

 - Better intro text.  Present, action, now ... you are part of the secret ...

 - Time bonus for sinking ships



 - How to handle the difficulty ?  Most gamers should be able to finish the game in about 10 minutes.

   - Count planes lost instead of lives remaining.   And give a bonus div by this (+1) at the end :) 

   - Multiple difficulties ?  Hard.  Needs UI on title screen.

   - Adaptive difficulty ?  Harder the more lives you have left ?  
     What can be tweaked ?  Enemy shooting pause.  Eplane spawn pause.  Eplane spawn numbers.  Ship hp - aa hp - plane hp - balloon hp.  

   - Bonus for lives left after each sinking ?
   - Get bonus life after each sinking ?



MAYBE/WONT:
 - For every second level completed ... that can be chosen from start screen
 - Add smoldering wreckage of destroyed aa guns
 - Player HP ?  And health bar ?
 - Water splash effect (things falling into water, wake after ship, etc.)
 - Limit number of player shots on screen ... ?  20 ?? Else it is too easy for fast tappers.
 - Enemy planes are behind the clouds
 - Clouds could be nicer ...
 - In transition draw hero on top and add black square behind him
 - Title screen: select level
 - Title screen: toggle music
