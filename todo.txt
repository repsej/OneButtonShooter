TODO: 

 - Make pos of player be set to a number of tiles and not a percentage of the screen.

 - Go to next level

 - Multiple levels ... every second is fighting a boat ... like in 1943

 - Shorter levels

 - Maybe reuse same level for run ups ? ... first w only planes ... then also islands w aa guns ... last w also barrage balloon

 - Just making the levels might compress better than writing the logic ??

 - For every second level completed ... that can be chosen from start screen

 - Level transition with plane doing a roll (not realistic)

 - Change colors to make it look like early sunrise (or late sunset)

 - Test on mobiles

 - Water splash effect (things falling into water, wake after ship, etc.)
