TODO: 

 - Rotating from portrait to landscape buggy on phone.  
   "After rotating, the screen is cut in half.  After dieing three times, it fixes itself.  But its not in fullscreen mode, so the browser bar takes up 1/3 of the screen"

WORKS NOW ?

 - Flavor text for each level
 
 - Make sure hiscore works

 - Show hiscore on title screen
 - Show player in middle on win screen
 - Win screen continue

 - Make pos of player be set to a number of tiles and not a percentage of the screen.

 - For every second level completed ... that can be chosen from start screen

 - Test on mobiles





MAYBE/WONT:
 - Add smoldering wreckage of destroyed aa guns
 - Player HP ?  And health bar ?
 - Water splash effect (things falling into water, wake after ship, etc.)
 - Limit number of player shots on screen ... ?  20 ?? Else it is too easy for fast tappers.
 - Enemy planes are behind the clouds
 - Clouds could be nicer ...
 - In transition draw hero on top and add black square behind him
 - Have scrolling text that describes the BCS ... old movie style
 - Title screen: select level
 - Title screen: toggle music
