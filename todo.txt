TODO: 

 - Infinite continues :) ... from the current level ... count down on Game Over screen ... hold button to continue



 - How would it work with "realistic" xspeed ... aka the real x speed of the angle of the player plane

 - Pause on game over before you can continue (to hear the slow music)

 - Show player in middle on win screen

 - Test on mobiles.  Works fine on Android :) ... but what about Apple ?  It does run horrible in Safari ...

 - Time bonus for sinking ships







MAYBE:
 - For every second level completed ... that can be chosen from start screen
 - Add smoldering wreckage of destroyed aa guns
 - Player HP ?  And health bar ?
 - Water splash effect (things falling into water, wake after ship, etc.)
 - Limit number of player shots on screen ... ?  20 ?? Else it is too easy for fast tappers.
 - Enemy planes are behind the clouds
 - Clouds could be nicer ...
 - In transition draw hero on top and add black square behind him
 - Title screen: select level
 - Title screen: toggle music


 - How to handle the difficulty ?  Most gamers should be able to finish the game in about 10 minutes.
  - Count planes lost instead of lives remaining.   And give a bonus div by this (+1) at the end :) 
  - Multiple difficulties ?  Hard.  Needs UI on title screen.
  - Adaptive difficulty ?  Harder the more lives you have left ?  
    What can be tweaked ?  Enemy shooting pause.  Eplane spawn pause.  Eplane spawn numbers.  Ship hp - aa hp - plane hp - balloon hp.  
  - Bonus for lives left after each sinking ?
  - Get bonus life after each sinking ?

WONT:

 - Limit player bullets on screen (prevent fast tappers from having it too easy)
   NAH .... doesnt work !
