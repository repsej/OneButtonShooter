TODO: 


 - Make sure hiscore works

 - Pause on game over before you can continue (to hear the slow music)

 - Show hiscore on title screen
 - Show player in middle on win screen

 - Make pos of player be set to a number of tiles and not a percentage of the screen.

 - Test on mobiles





MAYBE/WONT:
 - For every second level completed ... that can be chosen from start screen
 - Add smoldering wreckage of destroyed aa guns
 - Player HP ?  And health bar ?
 - Water splash effect (things falling into water, wake after ship, etc.)
 - Limit number of player shots on screen ... ?  20 ?? Else it is too easy for fast tappers.
 - Enemy planes are behind the clouds
 - Clouds could be nicer ...
 - In transition draw hero on top and add black square behind him
 - Have scrolling text that describes the BCS ... old movie style
 - Title screen: select level
 - Title screen: toggle music
