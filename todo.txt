TODO:

 - In transition draw hero on top and add black square behind him


 - Title screen: select level
 - Title screen: toggle music

 - Make pos of player be set to a number of tiles and not a percentage of the screen.

 - For every second level completed ... that can be chosen from start screen

 - Test on mobiles

 - Water splash effect (things falling into water, wake after ship, etc.)
 
 - Add smoldering wreckage of destroyed aa guns

 - Rotating from portrait to landscape buggy on phone.  
   "After rotating, the screen is cut in half.  After dieing three times, it fixes itself.  But its not in fullscreen mode, so the browser bar takes up 1/3 of the screen"

 - Player HP ?  And health bar ?

 - Limit number of player shots on screen ... ?  20 ?? Else it is too easy for fast tappers.
